I have begun this project and following are the things i learnt from here.
1. The mobile navigation using translateX() and transition will work fine in desktop, but when I switched to 
my android device it overflow and overflow-x:hidden won't fix that.

2. I used vh and vw extensively but I was extremely wrong and now i realize that to center the each section I used 
.sectionCenter {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding: 0 3rem;
  max-width: 120rem;
}

where margin-left and right are auto and then the padding will handle with left and right spacing with about 3 rem
now, i don't have to worry about centering that section always.


3. when designing accordian i faced issues hence I am able to tackle since I know css specificity

add hide class in the parent container and in css section do this, this will toggle the class whenever necessary in the javascript.

.button-open {
  display: none;
}
.hide .cardFlex .button-open {
  display: block;
}
.hide .txt-show {
  display: none;
} /* ************************************** */

.hide .cardFlex .button-close {
  display: none;
}

also remember to place two svg's inside a single button to make things simpler like: 

<button class="btn">
              <svg
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                fill="none"
                viewBox="0 0 24 24"
                stroke-width="1.5"
                stroke="currentColor"
                class="size-7 button-open"
              >
                <path
                  stroke-linecap="round"
                  stroke-linejoin="round"
                  d="m19.5 8.25-7.5 7.5-7.5-7.5"
                />
              </svg>

              <svg
                xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                fill="none"
                viewBox="0 0 24 24"
                stroke-width="1.5"
                stroke="currentColor"
                class="size-7 button-close"
              >
                <path
                  stroke-linecap="round"
                  stroke-linejoin="round"
                  d="m4.5 15.75 7.5-7.5 7.5 7.5"
                />
              </svg>
            </button>
